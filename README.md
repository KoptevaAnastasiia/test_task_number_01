# Test Task

## Overview
This project involves working with a relational database to analyze and visualize data from various tables related to user orders, subscriptions, quizzes, and products. The SQL queries provided in this repository focus on two key analysis tasks:
1. Conversion rate from quiz to order by funnel, grouped by year-month cohorts.
2. Weekly gross revenue and refund rate by country for the period June 2023 to December 2023.

The project includes the following components:
- `data.sql`: The SQL script used to create tables and load data from CSV files.
- `question_01.sql`: SQL query to calculate the conversion rate from quiz to order by funnel, grouped by cohort.
- `question_02.sql`: SQL query to calculate total revenue and refund rate by week and country.

## Database Schema
The database used for this task is `test_task_work12`. It includes the following tables:

- **orders_table**: Contains transaction data for user orders including order details, status, and amounts.
- **users_table**: Contains user data such as email, ID, country, age, gender, and UTM source.
